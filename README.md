# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various classification algorithms. The project utilizes the popular scikit-learn library in Python and explores the performance of different classifiers.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on several features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more. I have implemented and evaluated the following machine learning classifiers:

Logistic Regression  <br>
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  <br>
Decision Tree Classifier  <br>
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier <br>
Random Forest Classifier

## Results
Here are the accuracy scores achieved by each classifier on the test data:

Logistic Regression: 78.73% <br>
Support Vector: 81.34%  <br>
Decision Tree: 77.61% <br>
K-NN Classifier: 81.34% <br>
Random Forest: 82.84% <br>

The Random Forest classifier outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy.
